# DenScript-LED-V1.0

The DenScript LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a standard 5mm LED, housed in a convenient package together with a current limiting resistor, that allows it to be easily attached to projects, with our DenScript colour coded headers to make wiring far easier! Simply connect the RED pin to positive voltage (VCC), the BLACK pin to negative voltage (GND) and the WHITE pin to an output pin on your micro controller or development board!
